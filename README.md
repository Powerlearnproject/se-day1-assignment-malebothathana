Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the ability of using engineering principles and other techniques to develop, design and test apps or websides or AI  and to maintain its system regularly to esure that it is accurate, reeliable and to ensure that it meets the intended purpose while making life easy.
the importance of software engineering lies in the following points, being RELIABLE by making sure it is runs as expected without errors especially in situations that reecure precission like healthcare apps and financial related apps, SCALABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY meaning that the system has the ability to handle extensive workload without lagging or crashing. COST SAVING- to reduce development and maintanace costs bycatching errors or bugs early. SECURITY AND TRUST- ensures that software is secure and trustworthy, EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY- improves development team efficiency and productivity

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity-focused on understanding and managing the complexity of software systems, mastring process-it emphisized the importance of software development processes' including equirements gathering, design, testing, and maintanance, mastering the machine-focuses of the ability to harness the power of computers to automate and support software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
PLANNING- to identify software requirements, purpose and scope. REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS- to identify final user specifications, DESIGN- is building the framework, CODING- is converting software design into tangible code, TESTING- to make sure code is error free and bug  free and to ensure it runs smooth.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL METHODOLOGY- is linear and sequencial, each phase completed before the next EG=customer feedback comes late after the product is developed.
AGILE METHODOLOGY- iterative and incremental with multiple cycles (sprints) EG= regular customer feedback is incoporated into every sprint.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER- ROLES= developing applications, programs and systems using prpogramming languages and framework. responsibilities include ( maintining and updating software, to work with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software and to report on the progress of the software development), QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER- ROLES= to work with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements, responsibilities include (creating development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow, comfirm that the software meets the requirements before deployment), PROJECT MANAGER- ROLES= essembles and leads the software development team, responsibilities include (creating the bluueprint for the whole project and discussing the project and it's requirements with the clients and software developers)

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
the importance of (IDEs) is that programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules,it contains many intelligent features for automatically writting or editing the source code and an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the deloper begins typing. EG= visual studio code(VSCODE)
the importance of (VCS) is that it enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts and it records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. EG= GIT
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT places considerable pressure on software developers to stay current- the solution is to adopt continuous learning practices using the agile methodology to adaptemerging trends,  evolving their skills to merge the constantly growing industry
TIME CONSTRAINTS- software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under pressure for meeting tight deadlines, the solution is to use methods like SCRUM to streamline big loads of work by dividing onto manageable sprints
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 UNIT TESTS- are close to the source of an application, specialize intesting individual methods and functions of classes, components or modules used by the software, its importance is to ensure that every unit performs with precision without tempering with other units......INTEGRATION TESTS- ensures that various components 
used by the software work well together, it's importance is to help data flow smoothly between components and modules and make sure it works as expected....SYSTEM TESTS= focuses of the entire software as a whole including all functions and interactions, it's importance is to make sure that the system meets all the fuctional and non functional requirements(perfomance, security and usability)......ACCEPTANCE TESTS= formal tests that verify if the system meets are the requirements of the businness satisfacotory so, it's importance is to test while running the app to ensure it works as epected and focus on replicating the user behaviors
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
PROMPT ENGINEERING is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outcomes
it is important because itmakes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt, it increases fleibility by creating prompts with domain neutral instructions showing logical links and clear broad patterns
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt=draw a picture of a flower
draw a picture of a red rose that has a long stem and is planted in a grey vase near a pond that is surrounded by freshly cut grass on a rainy day with trees in the backround
CLARITY= it clearly specifies the colour of the rose, its location and the type of stem it has, rather than just a "rose"
SPECIFIC DETAILS= the length of rose,its colour,in which pot or vase, near which object and the backround
CONCISE= the additional information helps the AI generate a more precise image because the details help it produc what is needed.
